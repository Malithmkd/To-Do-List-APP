On my way in learning ReactJS, I have developed a To-Do-List-App to arrange and manage user's works.
When User Add Tasks: ![Screenshot (321)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/279eb3f3-1c11-43bd-990a-46bab9294615)
User can move tasks up as they prefer :![Screenshot (322)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39265502-c8c5-4fb7-bc56-2f84e5aac3a7)
User can move tasks down as they prefer :![Screenshot (323)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4822fadd-bf38-410b-8eb5-6a059907a5f5)
When user press "Add" button without typing new task, It will display error message : ![Screenshot (324)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37106b87-e022-4d91-87dd-dfdbd9d909c0)
